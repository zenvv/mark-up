## Features Overview

SvelteKit introduces a host of features that make web development a breeze. From file-based routing to server-side rendering, it covers it all. Let's explore some standout features:

- **File-based Routing**: SvelteKit's file-based routing simplifies project organization. Here's a glimpse of a typical project structure:

  ```plaintext
  src/
  ├── routes/
  │   ├── index.svelte
  │   ├── about.svelte
  │   └── contact.svelte
  ```

- **Automatic Code Splitting**: Enjoy the benefits of automatic code splitting for efficient loading. This means only the required JavaScript is loaded for each page, contributing to faster load times.

- **Server-side Rendering (SSR)**: Boost performance by leveraging SSR. SvelteKit pre-renders pages on the server, ensuring users receive content swiftly.

## Reactive Magic in SvelteKit

SvelteKit's reactive programming paradigm brings a touch of magic to development. Check out this example of a reactive component:

<figure>
<figcaption>counter.svelte</figcaption>

```svelte
<script>
	let count = 0

	function increment() {
		count += 1
	}
</script>

<button on:click={increment}>
	Clicked {count}
	{count === 1 ? 'time' : 'times'}
</button>
```

</figure>
The declarative syntax and automatic DOM updates make building interactive components a joy.

## Deployment Options

Deploying SvelteKit applications is a straightforward process, especially with serverless deployment options. Consider the following steps for a Vercel deployment:

1. Install the Vercel CLI:
   <figure>
      <figcaption>bash</figcaption>

   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

   </figure>

2. Deploy your SvelteKit app:
   <figure>
      <figcaption>bash</figcaption>

   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

   </figure>
